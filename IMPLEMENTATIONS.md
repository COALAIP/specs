# Reference Implementations

We're currently in the process of implementing reference implementations of this specification in
Python. To learn more, visit our repositories for:

- [`pycoalaip` - A Python library for creating COALA IP models in JSON-LD and IPLD](https://github.com/bigchaindb/pycoalaip)
- [`pycoalaip-bigchaindb` - A plugin for `pycoalaip` to persist COALA IP models on BigchainDB](https://github.com/bigchaindb/pycoalaip-bigchaindb)

We'd love to see other other implementations! See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to help.
